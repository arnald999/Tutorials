This is a **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) Tutorial to Text Classification**.

This is the fourth in [a series of tutorials](https://github.com/sgrvinod/Deep-Tutorials-for-PyTorch) I'm writing about _implementing_ cool models on your own with the amazing PyTorch library.

Basic knowledge of PyTorch, recurrent neural networks is assumed.

If you're new to PyTorch, first read [Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) and [Learning PyTorch with Examples](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html).

Questions, suggestions, or corrections can be posted as issues.

I'm using `PyTorch 0.4` in `Python 3.6`.

# Objective

**To build a model that can label a text document as one of several categories.**

 We will be implementing the [Hierarchial Attention Network (HAN)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/papers/16HLT-hierarchical-attention-networks.pdf), one of the more interesting and interpretable text classification models.

This model not only classifies a document, but also _chooses_ specific parts of the text –  sentences and individual words – that it thinks are most important.

# Tutorial in Progress

I am still writing this tutorial.

In the meantime, you could take a look at the code – it works!

We achieve an accuracy of **74.8%** (against **75.8%** in the paper) on the [Yahoo Answer dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz8a_Dbh9Qhbd2JNdDBsQUdocVU).
